Readme for those downloading the JDO Learning Tools from the
Apress site.

Description of ZIP file contents
--------------------------------

This zip contains the JDO Learning Tools which provide the example
programs discussed in my book "Using and Understanding Java Data
Objects." The JDO Learning Tools are open source.  The most recent
version is hosted on SourceForge.net, at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jdo-tools/ .

The version of the tools available at Apress will generally be the
most recently released version of the tools.  It is expected that all
1.x versions of the JDO Learning Tools will be compatible with the
tutorial in the book.

This version of the tools corresponds to v1-0-beta-2 available on
SourceForge.net.  It contains both the source code for the programs
and the image files used by some of the programs.  Since the image
file are not expected to change, you need to download them only once.

This version of the tools and the v1-0-beta-2 version of the tools
are identical. 

Instructions to install the JDO Learning Tools
----------------------------------------------

Unzip this zip to a directory of your choice.  Using your browser, open
doc/Overview.html.

If you are unable to use a browser for some reason, you can open
Overview.asc using a text editor.  The ASCII file is the source file
for the HTML file.  It is almost as readable as the HTML file.


Thank you for your interest in my book,

P.S.  if you send me e-mail, make sure that your first message has
"jdo-tools" in the subject heading to avoid the spam filters which are
a bit aggressive.
